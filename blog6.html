                            Aside from being a journal keeper, I'm also a snail mailer. I started this hobby as a postcrosser, posting postcards on
                            random postcrossers, and it was a disaster! I didn't like it! But thanks to Instagram, a snail-mailing community had
                            introduced me to a new world of making friends. I wrote letters and greeting cards for my family and several love
                            letters, but those are too seldom. Snail mailing had broadened my experience from receiving a letter from a friend on
                            the other side of the planet. I always wanted to buy postal stamps and used them to mail letters to friends. Because of
                            email, we often neglected to use the traditional handwritten mails (aside from bills, which is a burden to keep in the
                            mailbox). It gives me the joy to receive a pretty designed letter from a friend, and reading it makes me happier. With
                            snail-mailing, I met a friend while traveling. I always wanted to meet all of my pen friends. Luckily, I had.
                            Eventually, I will. We had exchanged a couple of mail already and exchanging travel experiences and thoughts. Though the
                            mails arrive too slow, that's the beauty behind it. And also, the idea of making it is an excellent appreciation of a
                            friendship that started on pen and paper.
