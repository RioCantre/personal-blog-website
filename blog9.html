                            I grew up and was born in one of the islands of the Philippines. Being away from my motherland, I didn't realize I was
                            homesick. I visited my homeland, but I didn't document it while visiting the neighboring countries. Visiting a country
                            with little knowledge of the language was a challenge for me. But it was a fun experience at the same time. I traveled
                            few Asian countries and documented it in my journal. I met a penfriend and discussed stories over food. Stroll the city
                            and bid farewells. But my adventure has just started. My main objective was to be able to order a proper meal and eat it
                            properly. I mean, I was primarily alone during my trip, and ordering food can be a challenge, and eating with strangers.
                            I manage somehow. Extravagant as it is! You can't be poor when visiting Asian malls, and I became penniless after my
                            visit. Though the tourist spot was always packed, planning was convenient before arriving at the tour stations.
