                            I'm always a fan of anime. I admire the animation and creative stories.
                            Even the characters are adorable and relatable. Japan is known for "otaku" (a young person who is obsessed with
                            computers or particular aspects of popular culture to the detriment of their social skills.), I'm a "semi-otaku." A
                            couple of years I was watching anime, Japan released a "chibi" (Chibi (ちび or チビ) is a Japanese slang word describing
                            something short (an inanimate object, human or other animals). The term is used as widely to describe a specific
                            caricature style where characters are exaggeratedly drawn: small and chubby, with stubby limbs and oversized heads.) a
                            version of an anime figure. Because I admire some of the anime characters, I got hooked on the figure called Nendoroid.
                            The Nendoroid (ねんどろいど, Nendoroido) series is a brand of plastic figures created by the Japanese Good Smile Company in
                            2006. They typically depict characters from anime, manga, or video games and are designed with a large head and a more
                            petite body to give them a cute appearance. What I love about it, it has detachable facial expressions and body parts.
                            You can play around with it and customized the whole character. I enjoyed playing with it, and I thought of bringing it
                            with me while traveling or strolling a nearby city and taking photos. I got inspired by one of the famous Nendoroid
                            photographers on Instagram, and we used the hashtag #nendography. Some people love to take pictures with their
                            Nendoroid. I
                            collected a few of my favorite characters and tried to capture some photos with me while traveling, but I kept changing
                            accounts and lost most of them. Overall, my first hobby got me out and started to explore and made me cherish that small
                            thing can give you happiness.
