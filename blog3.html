                            I was gradually shaping my creative hobbies. Back in the day, I kept a diary with me to write my thoughts and secrets
                            (like my crushes at school) that was my logic when I was younger. I stopped having my dairy when I started working. I
                            got occupied and forgot to write my thoughts. I felt I'm so drained that I did not even realize that I'm having issues
                            with my mental health. Mental health is very crucial. Cause the way you think will be your reality. I thought I had
                            forgotten to write my diary! Then the depression came. I was devastated, so depressed. I tried writing it down on a
                            regular planner, but it wasn't fun. It made me feel like an emo girl writing her thoughts on a planner. Not until the
                            Traveler's company introduced a traveler notebook concept on social media. I love the idea. That's how I learn about
                            journaling. I thought journaling is for a journalist, but that's a different story. Journaling is like a dairy but a
                            mature approach that is suitable for older age. I kept a journal with me when I felt I'm creative. Journaling became my
                            best friend. And my journal collection grew. I didn't regret it, the first time I bought one. I especially like the
                            Traveler's Company notebook. Their concept of journaling is creative and for travelers with a free spirit. I consider
                            myself as one. It's free to dream!
