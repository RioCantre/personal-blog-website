            <p>
                Usually, my planner is not always full of appointments nor meetings, or exam dates. I'm just
                an average person with a typical day. But having a planner and always empty, it's depressing
                to look at. So I started to make it a bit catchy and creative. Some kept planners as part of
                their daily lives. I got inspired and created an ordinary day into a special one. Starting a
                planner is daunting at first—no idea what to plan nor how to get started. With the wide use
                of the internet, you can search for a community that can help you start making a creative
                planner. The wide range of journal keeping to creative planning brings fellow artists together. 
                There is also <em>Bujo</em> and <em>Bullet journals</em> to creative planning 
                and journaling. You can always choose which one you prefer.

                Over the years, most planners have remained largely the same and most of the designs of
                day planners felt like they were stuck in the 80’s. No wonder many of us abandoned them and 
                turned to our phones to replace them. Besides the cons of the phone planner, there is the 
                basic appeal of <u>tangible memories over technological memory</u> . We miss the <strong>handmade</strong> 
                feel; the creativity of doodling and journaling on paper. We place sentimental value on something when
                we’ve invested time and effort into creating it. Designing a completely original and
                personal snapshot of your daily life fosters a feeling of happiness and ownership more than 
                any phone calendar could ever give.
