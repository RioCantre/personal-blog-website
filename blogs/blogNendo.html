                I'm always a fan of anime. I admire the animation and creative stories.
                Even the characters are adorable and relatable. Japan is known for <em>"otaku"</em>
                (a young person who is obsessed with computers or particular aspects of popular culture
                to the detriment of their social skills.), I'm a <em>"semi-otaku."</em> A couple of years
                I was watching anime, Japan released a <em>"chibi"</em>(<strong>Chibi</strong>(ちび or チビ) is
                a Japanese slang word describing something short (an inanimate object, human or other
                animals). The term is used as widely to describe a specific caricature style where
                characters are exaggeratedly drawn: small and chubby, with stubby limbs and oversized
                heads.) a version of an anime figure. Because I admire some of the anime characters, I got
                hooked on the figure called <u>Nendoroid</u>. The Nendoroid (ねんどろいど, <strong>Nendoroido</strong>)
                series is a brand of plastic figures created by the <em>Japanese Good Smile Company</em> in
                2006. They typically depict characters from anime, manga, or video games and are designed
                with a large head and a more petite body to give them a cute appearance. What I love about
                it, it has detachable facial expressions and body parts. You can play around with it and
                customized the whole character. I enjoyed playing with it, and I thought of bringing it with
                me while traveling or strolling a nearby city and taking photos. I got inspired by one of
                the famous Nendoroid photographers on Instagram, and we used the hashtag
                <strong>#nendography</strong> . Some people love to take pictures with their Nendoroid.
                I collected a few of my favorite characters and tried to capture some photos with me while
                traveling,
                but I kept changing accounts and lost most of them.Overall, my first hobby got me out and
                started
                to explore and made me cherish that small thing can give you happiness.
