                Aside from being a journal keeper, I'm also a snail mailer. I started this hobby as a
                <em>postcrosser</em> , posting postcards on random postcrossers, and it was a disaster! 
                I didn't like it! But thanks to <strong>Instagram</strong>, a snail-mailing community had introduced me to 
                a new world of making friends. I wrote letters and greeting cards for my family and several love
                letters, but those are too seldom. Snail mailing had broadened my experience from receiving a letter
                from a friend on the other side of the planet. I always wanted to buy postal stamps and used 
                them to mail letters to friends. Because of email, we often neglected to use the traditional 
                handwritten mails (aside from bills, which is a burden to keep in the mailbox). It gives me the
                joy to receive a pretty designed letter from a friend, and reading it makes me happier. With
                snail-mailing, I met a friend while traveling. I always wanted to meet all of my pen friends.
                Luckily, I had. Eventually, I will. We had exchanged a couple of mail already and exchanging travel 
                experiences and thoughts. Though the mails arrive too slow, that's the beauty behind it. And also, 
                the idea of making it is an <u>excellent appreciation</u> of a friendship that started on pen and paper.

                In the age of modern technology, everything moves at a faster pace. Some may say that letter
                writing is a lost art, but in the age of Covid, itâ€™s been making a resurgence. There is no better 
                feeling than coming home from a long, stressful day and opening up your mailbox to find a letter from a friend.
