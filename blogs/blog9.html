                I grew up and was born in one of the islands of the Philippines. Being away from my
                <strong>motherland</strong>, I didn't realize I was <u>homesick</u>. I visited my homeland, but I didn't 
                document it while visiting the neighboring countries. Visiting a country with little knowledge 
                of the language was a challenge for me. But it was a fun experience at the same time. I traveled
                few Asian countries and documented it in my journal. I met a penfriend and discussed stories over 
                food. Stroll the city and bid farewells. But my adventure has just started. My main objective was 
                to be able to order a proper meal and eat it properly. I mean, I was primarily alone during my trip, 
                and ordering food can be a challenge, and eating with strangers. I manage somehow. Extravagant as 
                it is! You can't be poor when visiting Asian malls, and I became penniless after my visit. 
                Though the tourist spot was always packed, planning was convenient before arriving at the tour stations.

                The chaotic symphony that is backpacking Southeast Asia is one of the most fun and
                powerfully rewarding experiences any backpacker can have. If you are looking to embark on 
                the adventure of a lifetime, a journey backpacking through Southeast Asia will certainly fulfill 
                that dream beyond your <em>wildest imagination</em> .
