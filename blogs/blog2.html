                            I consider myself creative. I tried book scrapping and collage, but I only usually use regular tape. And then washi tape
                            came along. <strong>Washi tape</strong> is a pretty, decorative paper masking tape. It's thin, durable, made of natural 
                            fibers like hemp and bamboo, inexpensive, and comes in hundreds of colors and patterns. The tape is easy to stick on many 
                            surfaces — including wood, plastic, and metal — and is easy to remove without causing damage.
                            I was hesitant to buy some washi tape cause it's expensive when it was first released. I thought the design wasn't too
                            good for the price, but then a prettier design came out in the market as time passed. Most of them are limited edition.
                            I need to have some for myself. But it's expensive! I got myself a dozen that I like. My pen friends also gifted me and
                            asked them to buy it for me cause it was cheaper in their area. Washi tape had become part of my creative journaling. I
                            used it for mail and also for gifts. Some use it as art design, and it was impressive. I made friends who also love to
                            collect washi tapes, and it's an addictive hobby.
                            Aside from that, I bring some sample washi tape with me on my journal. I had a handful with me, and it will be here
                            forever.
