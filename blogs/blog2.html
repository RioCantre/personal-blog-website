                I consider myself creative. I tried book scrapping and collage, but I only usually use
                regular tape. And then washi tape came along. <strong>Washi tape</strong> is a pretty, 
                decorative paper masking tape. It's thin, durable, made of natural fibers like hemp and 
                bamboo, inexpensive, and comes in hundreds of colors and patterns. The tape is easy to 
                stick on many surfaces — including wood, plastic, and metal — and is easy to remove without 
                causing damage. I was hesitant to buy some washi tape cause it's expensive when it was first 
                released. I thought the design wasn't too good for the price, but then a prettier design came 
                out in the market. Most of them are limited edition. I need to have some for myself. 
                But it's expensive! I got myself a dozen that I like. My pen friends also gifted me and
                asked them to buy it for me cause it was cheaper in their area. Washi tape had become part
                of my creative journaling. I used it for mail and also for <u>gifts</u>. Some use it as art design, and 
                it was impressive. I made friends who also love to collect washi tapes, and it's an addictive hobby.
                Aside from that, I bring some sample washi tape with me on my journal. I had a handful with
                me, and it will be here forever.

                The term washi comes from the words <em>‘Japanese Paper’</em>. Washi Tape first originated from
                Japan from a masking tape company named Kamoi Kakoshi. In 2006, they received a request to 
                beautify their masking tape selection from a group of women and with their joint efforts, more 
                colors came into existence. The new product was released in 2008, and with media coverage
                taking over, more designs and patterns kept being produced. Now washi tape can be
                purchased all over the world.
