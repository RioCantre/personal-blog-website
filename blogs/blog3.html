                I was gradually shaping my creative hobbies. Back in the day, I kept a <em>diary</em> with me to
                write my thoughts and secrets (like my crushes at school) that was my logic when I was younger. 
                I stopped having my dairy when I started working. I got occupied and forgot to write my thoughts. 
                I felt I'm so drained that I did not even realize that I'm having issues with my mental health. 
                Mental health is very crucial. Cause the way you think will be your <u>reality</u>. I thought I had
                forgotten to write my diary! Then the depression came. I was devastated, so depressed. I
                tried writing it down on a regular planner, but it wasn't fun. It made me feel like an emo girl 
                writing her thoughts on a planner. Not until the Traveler's company introduced a traveler notebook 
                concept on social media. I love the idea.That's how I learn about journaling. I thought journaling 
                is for a journalist, but that's a different story. Journaling is like a dairy but a mature approach 
                that is suitable for older age. I kept a journal with me when I felt I'm creative. Journaling became my
                best friend. And my journal collection grew. I didn't regret it, the first time I bought
                one. I especially like the Traveler's Company notebook. Their concept of journaling is creative and 
                for travelers with a <strong>free spirit</strong>. I consider myself as one. It's free to dream!

                "I used to only write daily entries in the past, but now I use my journal to organise
                and draft blog posts too! I mostly write my book reviews in my journal before I put them up on 
                my blog ðŸ™‚ My journal is a sporadic little thing really! I write whatever I like in it. My journal 
                is the one place I go to whenever I feel overwhelmed (aka I could be overly excited, anxious, happy, 
                grateful, or even sad). Writing in my journal helps clear my head and calms me down!" â€”Cath
