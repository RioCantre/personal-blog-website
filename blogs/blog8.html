                One day, I thought to myself, "I want to be in Paris." So I did,
                I booked a flight and went to Paris for three days. It was my first time visiting. Within
                the three days, I had
                experienced a magical moment. So little knowledge of the language spoken, I had strolled the
                city with no issues. Every
                street was a masterpiece. People are hustling and wear headphones. I spend my first day with
                a friend to help me take
                photos to remember (I'm not photogenic) and stayed in a six female bedroom hostel and met a
                fellow traveler. We spent a
                night visiting a museum (though it's already closed) and ate ice cream. The next day, I was
                lucky enough that it was
                Sunday and the ticket to the museum of Musee d'Orsay was for free. It was one of the
                highlights of my visit. To finally
                visit the museum I admire. I was so happy that my stress was gone. Paris is such a beautiful
                country. On my last day, I
                went to see a consultant cause I needed help. My visit was eye-opening. The consultant
                helped me understand my problem
                with my mental health in general. I was so glad to meet her.

                    Magical yet chaotic, romantic yet dull, elegant yet dirty. The city can easily be
                    misunderstood, especially if you are
                    traveling to Paris for the first time.
